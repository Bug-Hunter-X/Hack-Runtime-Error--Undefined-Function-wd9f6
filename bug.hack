```hack
function foo(x: int): int {
  return x + 1;
}

function bar(x: int): int {
  return foo(x) * 2;
}

function main(): void {
  echo bar(5);
}
```
This code will produce a runtime error because the function `foo` is not defined.

**Explanation:**
The code seems to be missing the definition of the `foo` function. Without its implementation, the program cannot compile or execute correctly.
